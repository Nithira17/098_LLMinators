            "[\"Numbers.lk's first pre-election poll results point to Anura Kumara Dissanayake as the frontrunner in Sri Lanka's upcoming presidential election, though no candidate has secured a clear majority yet. The poll surveyed 2,048 adults across all 22 electoral districts online from April 4-18, and it has a margin of error of +/- 3.5%.\", 'According to the survey finding,  Anura Kumara Dissanayaka leads the presidential race with 46% support among Sri Lankan adults. He holds a substantial lead over Sajith Premadasa, who has 22% support, and the incumbent President Ranil Wickremesinghe, who trails with 18%. However, with 10% of voters still undecided and another 4% backing other candidates, the race remains open for potential shifts before election day.', \"Anuna Kumara Dissanayake's core strengths lie with Sri Lanka's youngest voters, securing a staggering 67% support among first-time voters. He also leads comfortably among the under-40 crowd. Premadasa counters with a base among older generations whose highest educational attainment is below A/L levels.\\nHowever, Premadasa significantly lags with first-time voters compared to the other top candidates. Only 3% of these crucial first time voters say they plan to vote for the SJB's Sajith Premadasa. At the same time, incumbent President Ranil Wickremesinghe captures 10% approval in this group.\\nAnother 10% of first-time voters report intending to vote for other candidates outside the top three. And a further 10% remain undecided, leaving a substantial pool of young votes still up for grabs.\", \"When it comes to older voters, support for the traditional candidates rises along with age. Sajith Premadasa's strongest base comes from voters aged 41 and above whose highest educational attainment is below A/L levels. In this demographic, Sajith Premadasa leads with 38% support, while Anura Kumara Dissanayake could muster only 28% backing. Ranil Wickremesinghe captures 21% of these older, comparatively less educated demographic while 14% remain undecided.\", \"This cohort represents by far the largest voter block in the country, with over 40% of Sri Lanka's total electorate falling into the category of being 41 or older with education below A/L level. Their sheer numbers give outsized importance to whichever candidate can most effectively court these more traditionalist voters with modest educational credentials.\", 'The sampling procedure and stratification weighting yield an overall margin of sampling error of ±3.5 percentage points at the 95% confidence level for the full unweighted sample of 2,048 Sri Lankan adults. This margin of error accounts for design effects from the weighting process.']\n"

            "['In first half of 2024, the most notable changes in voting intent were the rise in support for President Ranil Wickremasinghe as a potential Presidential candidate at the apparent expense of support for likely candidates from the NPP, SJB and SLPP. In IHP’s MRP (Multilevel Regression and Post-Stratification) model projections, support for NPP leader Anura Dissanayake, SJB leader Sajith Premadasa, and a generic SLPP candidate declined by 7%, 1% and 5% respectively from the first two months of the year to June/July 2024. The main beneficiary was President Wickremesinghe, whose support more than doubled, increasing 13% to 22% during the same period, although this still left him trailing in third place.', 'NPP leader, Anura Dissanayake, registered losses in support across most demographics, but the biggest losses were in his core base of the better-off, Sinhala and youth (18–29 years) voters, where support fell 12, 9, and 17 points respectively. Support amongst voters with a favourable view of the Aragalaya fell 9%–a bigger fall than Sajith Premadasa experienced, although he retained a strong lead over his opponents in these voters. He also lost support amongst voters who voted for Gotabaya Rajapakse or Sajith Premadasa in 2019, although the MRP estimates suggest he managed to consolidate his 2019 Presidential Election voters.', 'The shifts away from both Anura Dissanayake and Sajith Premadasa seem to have been largely to the gain of President Ranil Wickremesinghe. His support rose across all demographics, except in Muslims. This included a larger gain in women (+17% vs. +8% in men), improving his better performance in women. Shifts in his favour were biggest in better-off (+17), Sinhala (+16), older (+24), and former Gotabaya Rajapakse (+20) voters. But notably the biggest shifts in his favour were in anti-Aragalaya voters, where he gained 26 points to build a lead over all other likely candidates. To a considerable extent, President Wickremesinghe has been a major beneficiary of the core pro-government/Rajapakse/SLPP vote, which in the first half of the year largely collapsed across all demographics.', 'Unlike in conventional opinion surveys, IHP’s SLOTS MRP voting intent estimates are not weighted tabulations of the raw survey responses. First, non-responses and refusals to the voting history and voting intent questions are handled by multiple imputation models that consider a wide range of respondent characteristics and impute the probability distribution of who the respondent might have voted for or would vote for. Second, voting intent is estimated using Multilevel Regression and Post-Stratification (MRP) modelling. MRP involves modelling the voting choices of respondents in relation to their characteristics, and then using the estimated model parameters to predict how the full adult population would vote. As MRP does not lend itself to standard computations of survey error, IHP uses a multiple imputation approach to estimate the uncertainty in its model predictions, and this is reported as the margin of error. Specifically, the margin of error represents IHP’s best estimates of the range in which the true levels of voting intent would lie 95% of the time. The MoE here represents uncertainty related to how well the MRP model fits the observed data, as well as traditional sampling noise. However, it does not capture any systematic errors that might arise due to non-sample bias, such as when supporters of one party are less likely to be reached by phone or agree to be interviewed.', 'The analysis reported here are based on modelling of responses from 18,206 interviews conducted from 1 December 2021 to 19 August 2024, including 1,077 interviews conducted in January/February 2024 and 1,146 interviews conducted in June/July 2024. The margins of error are assessed as 2–4% for Ranil Wickremesinghe, Sajith Premadasa, and AK Dissanayake.']\n"
